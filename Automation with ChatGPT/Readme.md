# Automation with ChatGPT

## Project Description:

The Automation with ChatGPT project aims to automate various tasks using OpenAI's ChatGPT model. It is a Python script that interacts with the ChatGPT API to perform tasks based on user prompts. The program prompts the user to input a task or a query, and then utilizes ChatGPT to generate responses or perform actions accordingly.

## Key Features:

- **Task Automation:**
  - Accepts user prompts or queries for various tasks.
  - Utilizes ChatGPT's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to automate tasks.

- **Customizable Output:**
  - Allows users to specify the format or type of output generated by ChatGPT.

- **Interactive Chatbot:**
  - Provides an interactive chatbot experience where users can engage in conversations or request assistance.

- **API Interaction:**
  - Demonstrates practical use of OpenAI's ChatGPT API for conversational AI tasks.

## How It Works:

1. The program utilizes the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments.
   - Accepts one argument: `task` (user's prompt or query).

2. Constructs the necessary parameters for making a request to the ChatGPT API:
   - Endpoint URL (`gpt_endpoint`).
   - API key (`gpt_key`).
   - Headers for the HTTP request.

3. Sends a POST request to the ChatGPT API with the user's prompt as input.

4. Processes the API response:
   - If successful (HTTP status code 200), extracts the generated response from the API.
   - Displays or performs the action based on the response.
   - If the API request fails, it provides an error message along with the corresponding HTTP status code.

## Usage:

- Before running the script, declare your ChatGPT API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
- export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
- To generate a script or perform a task, run the script providing one command-line argument:
- `task`: The prompt or query for which a response or action is required.
- `filename`: The name of the file where the generated script or output will be saved.

Example usage:
- python automation.py "Generate a script to automatically segregate files into sub folders based on their file type" segregate_script.py

## Project Benefits:

- **Efficient Task Automation:** Automates various tasks based on user prompts.
- **Interactive Chat Experience:** Engages users in conversational interactions.
- **Customizable Output:** Allows users to specify the format or type of output generated.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API for conversational AI tasks.
